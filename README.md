# Stake Token Dapp:

The contract, a.k.a Stake Token Standard, is an extension of the ERC20 standard, it encorporates a mechanism to gain funding by way of stakers. Stakers are issued an ERC20 compatible token after they have staked. The contract could then be considered an ERC20 Stake Token. This coupled with a user interface is what we will call Catspers ƒêApp. The contracts' two "modes" of operations, that are not strict in their definitions or usees i.e. as a source of funding or staking.
